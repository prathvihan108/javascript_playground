# Key Points of async and await in JavaScript:

    Simplified Asynchronous Code:
        async and await make asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code, improving readability and maintainability.

    async Function:
        Declaring a function with async makes it return a Promise implicitly.
        You can use await inside an async function to pause execution until a Promise is resolved.

    await Keyword:
        The await keyword pauses the execution of the function until the Promise resolves or rejects.
        It can only be used inside async functions.

    Error Handling:
        Errors inside async functions can be caught using try...catch, which integrates seamlessly with synchronous error handling patterns.

    Non-Blocking Execution:
        Despite looking synchronous, async and await allow other code to execute while waiting for Promises to resolve.

    Chaining:
        You can chain multiple asynchronous operations in a clean and sequential manner using await.
