# Default Properties and Methods of a Function Object:

    length:
        Represents the number of arguments the function expects.
        For your function x:

     console.log(x.length); // Output: 0

    Since x does not expect any parameters, length is 0.

name:

    Contains the name of the function.
    For x:

    console.log(x.name); // Output: "x"

prototype:

    Every function has a prototype property, used when the function is intended to be a constructor.
    For x:

    console.log(x.prototype); // Output: {constructor: Æ’}

    It contains the default constructor property.

caller (Deprecated in strict mode):

    Refers to the function that called the current function. Not recommended for use due to deprecation in strict mode.

arguments (Deprecated in strict mode):

    Refers to the arguments passed to the function. Again, this is deprecated in strict mode.

Custom Properties:

    Functions can have custom properties. If you explicitly set a property on x, it will be part of x.
