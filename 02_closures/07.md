# var is function-scoped:

    When you declare var i, it is scoped to the entire function a, not to the loop block.
    The same i variable is shared across all iterations.
    By the time the setTimeout callbacks are executed (after i * 1000 milliseconds), the loop has already completed, and the value of i is 6.
    Therefore, all setTimeout callbacks log 6 to the console.

# let is block-scoped:

    When you declare let i, a new instance of i is created for each iteration of the loop.
    Each setTimeout callback closes over a different i variable, each with its own unique value for that iteration.
    Therefore, when the setTimeout callbacks are executed, they log the value of i as it was during that specific iteration.

# Why This Happens:

    With var: The closure created by setTimeout refers to the same i variable (function-scoped). When the loop completes, i has the value 6, and all closures see this value.
    With let: The closure created by setTimeout refers to a new, block-scoped i for each iteration. Each callback gets its own i value, preserving the value at the time of its creation.

# 1. Does the Previous let i Get Destroyed?

Yes, each iteration of the for loop with let creates a new instance of the loop variable. Once the iteration is completed:

    The previous instance of i is no longer accessible because it was scoped to that specific iteration.
    However, if a closure (like setTimeout) references it, the value of i for that iteration is preserved because the closure holds a reference to that specific instance of i.

# 2. Why No Redeclaration Error?

The reason why thereâ€™s no redeclaration error is due to how let works in for loops:

    Block Scope:
        let creates a new scope for each iteration.
        Each new scope contains a new instance of i that shadows the previous one.
        The for loop implicitly handles this redeclaration for you.

Think of it like this: during each iteration, a new "block" is created where i is declared fresh. After that iteration ends, the block is discarded, and the next iteration creates a new block.

# An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The name IIFE is promoted by Ben Alman in
we can use this to achieve the same result using the var
function a() {
    for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
        (function (currentValue) {
            setTimeout(function () {
                console.log(currentValue);
            }, currentValue * 1000);
        })(i); // Pass the current value of i to the IIFE
    }
}

a();
