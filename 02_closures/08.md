# In JavaScript, a constructor function is a special type of function used to create and initialize objects. When called with the new keyword, it acts as a blueprint for creating multiple objects with similar properties and methods.
Characteristics of Constructor Functions:

    Starts with a Capital Letter (Convention): By convention, constructor function names are capitalized to distinguish them from regular functions.
    Used with the new Keyword: When you use new, the function creates and returns a new object.
    Initializes Properties and Methods: You can define properties and methods for the object using this.

How Constructor Functions Work

When a constructor function is called with new:

    A new empty object is created.
    The this keyword inside the function refers to this new object.
    The object is linked to the prototype of the constructor.
    The constructor function implicitly returns the new object unless an object is explicitly returned.
