# In JavaScript, when you use setTimeout, the behavior of the function involves both the call stack and the callback queue, but the process of when it is added to the callback queue is important to understand.
Key Concepts:

    When setTimeout is Encountered:
        When the setTimeout function is encountered during the execution of the script, it sets up a timer for the specified duration (e.g., 3000ms in your case).
        The function (callback) inside setTimeout does not immediately go into the callback queue. Instead, it is scheduled to be executed after the timer expires.

    What Happens After 3000ms:
        Once the timer expires, the callback (your function in setTimeout) is placed in the callback queue.
        It waits in the callback queue until the call stack is empty. This means:
            If the main thread is busy executing other synchronous code, the callback will wait even if 3000ms have passed.
            Once the call stack is clear, the event loop picks the function from the callback queue and pushes it onto the call stack for execution.

    Important Note:
        The 3000ms timer is a minimum delay. The function is guaranteed to not run before 3000ms, but it might run later if the main thread is busy.



# In JavaScript, the timing for functions like setTimeout and setInterval is not handled by JavaScript itself. Instead, it is managed by the environment in which the JavaScript code is running. This could be a web browser or a Node.js runtime. Let's dive deeper:
1. JavaScript and its Execution Environment

    JavaScript is a single-threaded, synchronous language by design.
    However, when using setTimeout, the actual timer functionality is provided by the runtime environment (e.g., browser or Node.js).

2. How Timing Works in Different Environments
a) In Browsers:

    Web APIs provided by the browser handle timing functions.
    When you call setTimeout, the browser delegates the task of counting down to its timer system.
    After the specified time (e.g., 3000ms), the callback function is added to the callback queue.

b) In Node.js:

    In Node.js, timers like setTimeout are part of the Node.js Timers API.
    Node.js internally uses a library called libuv to handle asynchronous operations, including timers.
    The event loop in Node.js works similarly to the browser's event loop, ensuring the callback executes after the timer expires.
