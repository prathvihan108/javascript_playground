let x = 10; // x is a number
const y = "text"; // y is a string
var z = true; // z is a boolean
let b = null;

//null and undefined both are the datatypes.
//let var and const are not the data types
// let , var,const control  how datatypes are stored and accessed.
//null is a standalone value,which mean empty.
