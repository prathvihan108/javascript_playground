JavaScript Execution Context
# 1. What is Execution Context?

An Execution Context is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.
Types:

    Global Execution Context (GEC): Created when the script starts.
    Function Execution Context (FEC): Created whenever a function is invoked.

# 2. Phases of Execution Context
Phase 1: Memory Allocation (Creation Phase)

    Hoisting occurs:
        Function Declarations: Hoisted with their definitions.
        Variables (var): Hoisted but initialized to undefined.
        Variables (let and const): Hoisted but remain uninitialized (in Temporal Dead Zone, TDZ).

Phase 2: Code Execution

    Executes line by line.
    Initializes variables and executes functions.

# 3. Key Concepts
Hoisting:

    var → hoisted, initialized as undefined.
    let/const → hoisted, but in TDZ(Temporal dead Zone) until initialized.
    Function declarations → fully hoisted with their definitions.(Arrow functions are not hoisted).
