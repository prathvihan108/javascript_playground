# Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations (for variables), which can lead to some interesting (and sometimes confusing) behavior in JavaScript.
Key Points of Hoisting:

    Variable Hoisting:
        Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with undefined.
        Variables declared with let and const are hoisted, but remain in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until the execution reaches the line where they are initialized.

    Function Declaration Hoisting:
        Function declarations (using function name() {...}) are fully hoisted, meaning both their declaration and their definition are available throughout the entire scope, even before the function is written in the code.
        Function expressions (e.g., var foo = function() {...}) are not hoisted. The variable declaration (var foo) is hoisted, but the function definition is not available until the code execution reaches that line.


# Execution Context Stack (Call Stack) Process

    Creating the Global Execution Context (GEC):
        When the JavaScript program starts running, the Global Execution Context is created and pushed onto the stack.
        In the GEC, the global object (such as window in the browser or global in Node.js) and other initializations (like the this keyword) are set up.

    Function Call Creates a New Execution Context:
        Whenever a function is called, a new Execution Context is created for that function.
        This new context is pushed onto the stack on top of the current context (which could be the GEC or another function's execution context).
        The function's local variables, parameters, and this are initialized in this new context.

    Execution Context Lifecycle:
        Each execution context goes through three phases: Creation Phase, Execution Phase, and Destruction Phase.
