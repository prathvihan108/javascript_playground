Here are some important notes about strict mode and non-strict mode in JavaScript:
# Strict Mode:

    Enables Safer Code:
        Strict mode helps you write more secure and predictable JavaScript by catching common coding errors and throwing exceptions for bad syntax.

    Prevents Implicit Globals:
        In strict mode, any variable must be explicitly declared using var, let, or const. Assigning a value to an undeclared variable results in a ReferenceError.

    Disallows this in Global Context:
        In strict mode, this inside a regular function (not in an object method) will be undefined instead of referring to the global object (window in browsers).

    Prevents Deleting Variables:
        In strict mode, you cannot delete variables, functions, or function arguments, as they are not configurable.

    Disallows Duplicating Parameters:
        Strict mode prevents defining functions with duplicate parameter names, which is allowed in non-strict mode but can be confusing and error-prone.

    Silent Failures Are Thrown as Errors:
        In non-strict mode, some actions (like assigning a value to a read-only property) fail silently. In strict mode, these failures are thrown as errors.

    Throws Error on eval() Usage:
        In strict mode, the eval() function is more restricted in its behavior, limiting the creation of new variables and functions in its local scope.

    Requires Correct get/set Behavior:
        If a getter or setter is used incorrectly (e.g., trying to set a value to a non-writable property), it will throw an error in strict mode.

# Non-Strict Mode:

    Flexible but Risky:
        Non-strict mode is the default mode in JavaScript, where the language behaves more loosely, allowing for easier coding, but it can lead to unintended errors, especially with variable scoping and global variables.

    Implicit Globals:
        Variables that are assigned values without being explicitly declared (e.g., undeclaredVariable = 10;) are automatically treated as global variables in non-strict mode, which can cause issues in larger codebases.

    this Refers to the Global Object:
        In non-strict mode, the value of this in a function refers to the global object (window in browsers) if it is not used inside an object method, which can lead to bugs.

    Silent Failures:
        Certain actions that would cause an error in strict mode (like assigning a value to a read-only property) fail silently in non-strict mode without throwing any errors.

    Function Parameter Duplication:
        Non-strict mode allows functions to have duplicate parameter names, which can make debugging difficult, especially in large functions.

    No Error on Deleting Variables:
        In non-strict mode, it is possible to delete variables, functions, and function arguments, even though they are not meant to be deleted.

    Eval Behavior:
        In non-strict mode, the eval() function can introduce new variables into the surrounding scope, which can sometimes lead to hard-to-track bugs.

    Less Restrictive:
        Non-strict mode allows for more flexibility, but at the cost of safety. It may be easier to write code quickly, but this can lead to unpredictable behavior and bugs.
