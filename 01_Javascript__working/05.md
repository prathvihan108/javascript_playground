Lexical Environment in JavaScript

A Lexical Environment is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that defines the environment in which variables, functions, and their relationships are stored and accessed during the execution of the code.
 # Key Concepts of Lexical Environment:

    Definition:
        A Lexical Environment is a structure that holds variable and function declarations along with their associated values and provides the scope within which they can be accessed.
        It consists of two main components:
            Environment Record: Stores variable and function declarations.
            Outer Lexical Environment Reference: Points to the lexical environment of the parent (or outer) scope.

    Scope:
        The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed.
        Lexical scoping means that a function's scope is determined by its location in the source code (where it's written) and not where it is invoked.

# How Lexical Environment Works:

    Creation:
        Each time a function is called, a new lexical environment is created for that function.
        Similarly, when the global code is executed, a global lexical environment is created.

    Hierarchy:
        Lexical Environments are organized in a hierarchical structure, where each environment can reference its outer lexical environment.
        This hierarchy forms the scope chain.

    Accessing Variables:
        When trying to access a variable, JavaScript first looks in the current lexical environment.
        If not found, it moves to the outer lexical environment.
        This process continues up the scope chain until the variable is found or the global scope is reached.
